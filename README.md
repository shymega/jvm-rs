# jvm-rs

`jvm-rs` is an JVM implemented in Rust, with an emphasis on
performance and safety.

## Status

I am currently reading through the JVM specification in my free time.

I am also trying to juggle this studying with my other FLOSS projects,
college and personal matters, and hence, it might be a while before
things get underway.

## Usage

`jvm-rs` is not ready to be used yet, check back soon. Thanks.

## Community

There is a IRC channel for this project on Freenode under the
channel "#jvm-rs".

Feel free to come here to discuss ideas for jvm-rs.
