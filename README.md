# jvm-rs

## Summary

`jvm-rs` is an JVM implemented in Rust, with an emphasis on
performance and safety.

jvm-rs will use OpenJDK's `rt.jar` for the classpath to save lengthy
re-implementing. Additionally, as jvm-rs is just a POC of a JVM in
Rust with these specified goals, it is more logical to reuse existing
works.

## Status

This project is delayed right now, as it is waiting on several things-

1. @shymega (Me) to read through the JVM specification, and consider
   *how* to implement the JVM onto jvm-rs.

- Free time. I'm at college this year, studying many aspects of my
   courses and bogged down with assignments. Maybe by Gravmass time,
   I will have time to sit down and hack on this.

## Usage

`jvm-rs` is not ready to be used yet, check back soon. Thanks.

## Community

There is a IRC channel for this project on Freenode under the
channel "#jvm-rs".

Feel free to come here to discuss ideas for jvm-rs.
