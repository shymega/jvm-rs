# jvm-rs

`jvm-rs` is an JVM implemented in Rust, with an emphasis on
performance and safety.

## Status

I am currently reading through the JVM specification in my free time.

I am also trying to juggle this studying with my other FLOSS projects,
college and personal things, and hence, it might be a while before
things get underway.

## Usage

`jvm-rs` is not ready to be used yet, check back soon.

## Community

There is a IRC channel for this project on Freenode under the
channel "#jvm-rs".


## Status of development

I am currently busy with college at the moment and due to that, I am
very limited on time.

Hopefully when the workload of assignments comes down, I'll be able to
hack on this some more.
Feel free to come here to discuss ideas, etc.
