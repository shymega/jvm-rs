# JVM-rs

## Status

I'm taking a break from this project for now.

Starting to wonder if I'm biting off more than I can chew. I don't exactly think
this project will get further with just one developer, so for the time being,
please consider this project to be _on hold_ until further notice.

Thanks for checking it out though!

## Project description

`JVM-rs` is an JVM implemented in Rust, with an emphasis on
performance and safety.

JVM-rs will use OpenJDK's `rt.jar` for the classpath to save lengthy
re-implementing. Additionally, as JVM-rs is just a point of concept of
a JVM in Rust with these specified goals, it is more logical to reuse
existing works.
