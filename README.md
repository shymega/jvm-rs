# jvm-rs

`jvm-rs` is an JVM implemented in Rust, with an emphasis on
performance and safety.

## Status

I am currently reading through the JVM specification in my free time.

I am also trying to juggle this studying with my other FLOSS projects,
college and personal things, and hence, it might be a while before
things get underway.

## Usage

`jvm-rs` is not ready to be used yet.

## Community

There is no current community around this yet.

When development starts fully, I _might_ make an IRC channel -
probably on Freenode.

For now, please consider all 'communities' that claim to be affiliated
with `jvm-rs` unaffiliated with this project.

## Status of development

I am currently busy with college at the moment and due to that, I am
very limited on time.

Hopefully when the workload of assignments comes down, I'll be able to
hack on this some more.
