# JVM-rs

## Summary

`JVM-rs` is an JVM implemented in Rust, with an emphasis on
performance and safety.

JVM-rs will use OpenJDK's `rt.jar` for the classpath to save lengthy
re-implementing. Additionally, as JVM-rs is just a point of concept of
a JVM in Rust with these specified goals, it is more logical to reuse
existing works.

## Status

This project is delayed right now, as it is waiting on several things:

1. @shymega (Me) to read through the JVM specification and then plan
   how to implement the JVM.

- Free time. I'm at college this year, studying many aspects of my
   courses and bogged down with assignments.
   
UPDATE: Still bogged down with assignments, but I HAVE got the opcodes
in an Enum. Frickin' loads of 'em.

## Usage

`JVM-rs` is not ready to be used yet, check back soon. Thanks.
