# JVM-rs

## Status

I'm not working on this project anymore. I think I bit off more than I can chew,
but I really liked the idea of the JVM in Rust. Maybe one day I could return to
it, but for now it's too much for a sole dev.

Thanks for checking it out though!

## Project description

`JVM-rs` is an JVM implemented in Rust, with an emphasis on
performance and safety.

JVM-rs will use OpenJDK's `rt.jar` for the classpath to save lengthy
re-implementing. Additionally, as JVM-rs is just a point of concept of
a JVM in Rust with these specified goals, it is more logical to reuse
existing works.
